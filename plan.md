# Dungeon Master Map Tool - Living Specification

## 1) Chosen Technology Stack

- **Language/runtime:** Java 21
- **UI/rendering:** JavaFX + Canvas
- **Build/deps:** Maven
- **Codegen:** Lombok (DTOs/models/boilerplate reduction)
- **Project save format:** Versioned JSON (`.dmmap`)
- **DD2VTT import:** Jackson for JSON parsing
- **Math/geometry:** JTS (or lightweight in-house geometry where enough)

## 2) Product Goals

Desktop tool for tabletop dungeon masters that:

1. Imports universal-export **dd2vtt** maps (e.g., from Dungeon Alchemist).
2. Provides smooth DM-side map navigation (zoom, pan, camera controls).
3. Supports optional borderless fullscreen **player view** on a second display.
4. Supports fog of war, lighting, and overlay drawing workflows fast enough for live sessions on a mid-range laptop.
5. Supports creating custom maps from imported images while keeping full feature parity with imported dd2vtt maps.

## 3) Core Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Import and Map Model

- Import dd2vtt map files.
- Create custom maps by drag-and-drop image import (png/jpg/webp) into a map canvas.
- Allow image layer transform editing (move, resize/scale, optional rotate) directly with drag handles.
- Parse and store:
  - base image path/data
  - grid size/scale
  - wall/occluder data for line of sight
  - dd2vtt lights
  - dd2vtt doors/windows and their interaction metadata
  - metadata required for rendering
- Convert imported content into internal project model and allow saving as `.dmmap`.
- Use the same internal model/save format for dd2vtt and custom-image maps so all features (fog, lights, overlays, player view, freeze) work identically.
- Imported dd2vtt semantics must remain functional after conversion (no loss of core gameplay behavior).
- Import must **copy all required source data/assets** from the dd2vtt location into app-managed project storage so the original file location (e.g., USB drive) is no longer required afterward.

## 3.2 DM View

- Zoom in/out around cursor focus.
- Pan/camera movement via drag and/or keybind.
- Render overlays (fog, lights, shapes) with editing controls.
- Show player viewport rectangle when player screen is active.
- Provide a map-rotation menu action to rotate the entire map in **90-degree steps** (0/90/180/270).
- Use an on-canvas **DM-only control overlay** (instead of top window menu) for core actions like import/open/save, player-view controls, ping, and rotation.
- Remember the last dd2vtt import directory and reopen that location for the next import dialog.
- Open-project dialog defaults to the app-managed `dmmap-projects` save directory.

## 3.3 Player View (Second Screen)

- Optional separate window on selected monitor.
- DM can choose the exact target monitor for player view from an in-app screen selector (supports 2+ monitor setups reliably).
- Borderless fullscreen mode.
- Adjustable world-to-screen scale so each tile is approximately **1 inch** physical size.
- Player window mirrors a movable camera rectangle controlled from DM view.
- Freeze mode: player view remains fixed while DM prepares another map/view.
- While frozen, DM can still move the player viewport rectangle; on unfreeze, player view immediately jumps to that staged rectangle.
- Player view must stay visually clean: DM-only helper/debug geometry (wall guides, door/window state lines, viewport handles) is never rendered there.

## 3.4 Map Switching

- Fast map/project switcher UI.
- If player view is frozen, switching/opening in DM view must not affect player output until unfreeze/swap action.

## 3.5 Fog of War

- Fog toggle on/off without losing reveal state.
- Reveal/hide via:
  - brush (size configurable)
  - rectangular drag tool
- DM fog rendering: semi-transparent (DM sees obscured content faintly).
- Player fog rendering: fully concealing except revealed/light-visible regions.

## 3.6 Dynamic Lighting

- Add/remove/move one or more light sources in DM view.
- Each light has:
  - range/radius
  - intensity/falloff preset
  - optional flicker (torch-style)
- Player view shows resulting illumination only (not editor token glyphs).
- LOS and occlusion use imported dd2vtt wall data.

## 3.7 Time-of-Day Lighting

- 4 presets (e.g., Day, Dusk, Night, Dawn or user-renamable variants).
- Preset affects ambient light color/intensity globally.

## 3.8 Tactical/AOE Overlays

- Draw circles/rectangles/free brush overlays.
- Adjustable color and transparency.
- Visible in both DM and player views (unless explicitly hidden).
- Persist in save file.

## 3.9 Map Ping Tool

- DM can place quick pings on the map to direct player attention.
- Ping appears immediately in DM and player views at world position.
- Ping should be visually obvious (short animation + fade out).
- Support at least one default ping style initially; extensible for variants later.

## 3.10 Doors, Windows, and dd2vtt Interactables

- Imported doors and windows must be represented as interactable map objects.
- DM can open/close doors and windows directly from DM view.
- Open/closed state affects line of sight and lighting occlusion in real time.
- Interactable states must render correctly in DM and player views.
- Open/closed state must be persisted in `.dmmap`.

## 3.11 Persistence

- `Ctrl+S` saves current project state.
- Save includes at minimum:
  - imported map reference/data
  - fog state
  - reveal mask
  - light definitions
  - imported/interactable object states (doors/windows)
  - time-of-day preset
  - overlays/shapes
  - ping-related settings/history if configured to persist
  - DM/player camera states
  - freeze mode state
- Include schema version for migrations.
- Saved projects must remain loadable even when original import paths are unavailable (offline/removed external media).

## 3.12 Undo/Redo History

- `Ctrl+Z` undoes the most recent DM action.
- Undo must cover at least:
  - moving map/image layers
  - whole-map rotation
  - adding/removing/moving lights
  - opening/closing doors and windows
  - fog-of-war reveal/hide actions (brush and rectangle tools)
- Undo must update both DM and player views immediately after action rollback.
- Undo state is session-local (not required to persist across app restarts in v1).
- Add `Ctrl+Y` redo support as part of the same command-history system.

## 3.13 Custom Map Builder

- Provide an editor mode for quick map assembly from one or more dropped images.
- Support snapping/scaling against grid so map tiles align predictably.
- Persist image layer stack order and transforms in `.dmmap`.
- Allow adding walls manually for custom-image maps so LOS lighting remains usable even without dd2vtt wall data.

## 3.14 Whole-Map Rotation

- Support rotating the complete map scene in 90-degree intervals via menu controls.
- Rotation applies to all map-linked systems consistently:
  - base image/image layers
  - walls/LOS blocking geometry
  - fog mask and revealed areas
  - light positions and LOS output
  - overlays/shapes
  - DM and player camera framing
- Rotation state must be persisted and restored from `.dmmap`.

## 5) Performance Targets (Mid-range Laptop)

- 60 FPS target when idle/panning on typical map sizes.
- Keep heavy recomputation incremental:
  - cached fog mask textures
  - cached LOS polygons per light unless moved/changed
  - dirty-rectangle redraw strategy where practical
- Non-blocking file IO for import/save to keep UI responsive.

## 6) Architecture Outline

- `core-model`: map state, entities, serialization DTOs.
- `import-dd2vtt`: parser + normalization into internal model.
- `render-engine`: layers (base map, fog, lights, overlays, UI guides).
- `editor-tools`: brush/rect reveal, shape tools, light tools.
- `player-output`: second window lifecycle, monitor placement, fullscreen.
- `persistence`: `.dmmap` read/write, migration handlers.
- `history`: command stack for undo/redo transactions.

## 7) Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Skeleton + Import + Basic Viewing

1. Maven project setup (JavaFX app bootstrap).
2. dd2vtt import flow (including lights + doors/windows metadata).
3. Custom-map image drag-and-drop + resize baseline.
4. DM canvas with zoom/pan.
5. Whole-map 90-degree rotation menu + persistence baseline.
6. Basic map switcher.
7. Undo/redo command-stack baseline (`Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`) wired for map transforms and door/window state changes.

## Phase 2 - Player Window + Camera Linking

1. Second-window management and monitor targeting.
2. Borderless fullscreen mode.
3. DM-visible draggable player viewport rectangle.
4. Freeze/unfreeze player output.

## Phase 3 - Fog of War System

1. Fog mask model + persistence.
2. Brush and rectangle reveal tools.
3. DM-vs-player fog rendering differences.
4. Toggle fog without reset.

## Phase 4 - Lighting + LOS

1. Light entities and manipulation.
2. LOS occlusion from walls + door/window state.
3. Flicker behavior.
4. Time-of-day ambient presets.
5. Interactive open/close controls for doors/windows.
6. Undo/redo integration for add/remove/move light operations.

## Phase 5 - Overlays + Save Polish

1. Circle/rect/brush overlays with color + alpha.
2. Ctrl+S project save/load polish.
3. Migration-safe schema versioning.
4. Manual wall editing for custom-image maps.
5. Ping tool (animated attention marker).
6. Undo/redo integration for fog brush/rectangle actions.
7. Performance optimization pass.

## 8) Open Decisions (Track Here)

- Exact tile-to-inch calibration UX (manual slider vs calibration wizard).
- Whether to store fog as stroke history, bitmap mask, or hybrid representation.
- Minimum supported GPU/OpenGL profile for JavaFX on older laptops.

## 9) Change Log

- **v0.1:** Initial requirement mapping + selected stack locked.
- **v0.2:** Added custom map builder requirements (drag/drop images, resizing, shared `.dmmap` model parity, manual walls).
- **v0.3:** Added whole-map 90-degree rotation via menu with save/restore in `.dmmap`.
- **v0.4:** Added ping tool, full dd2vtt lights/doors/windows support, and DM door/window interaction with persisted open/closed state.
- **v0.5:** Import now requires copying dd2vtt/source assets into managed project storage so external source media is not needed after import.
- **v0.6:** Added Lombok as implementation dependency and defined testing strategy (unit/integration/regression/manual acceptance).
- **v0.7 (current):** Added command-history undo/redo requirements (`Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`) for map transforms, lights, door/window state, and fog-of-war edits.

## 10) Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests (JUnit 5):**
  - dd2vtt parsing/normalization (walls, lights, doors/windows).
  - `.dmmap` serialization/deserialization and schema-version migration.
  - Geometry/LOS calculations, door/window occlusion state changes.
  - Fog mask operations (brush/rect reveal consistency).
  - command-history action inversion tests (undo/redo for move/rotate/light/door/fog operations).
- **Integration tests:**
  - Import dd2vtt -> save `.dmmap` -> reload -> verify state parity.
  - External-source removal scenario (import from removable path, then load from copied project assets only).
  - Whole-map rotation (0/90/180/270) preserving interactables, lights, fog, overlays.
  - Multi-step undo/redo sequences preserving deterministic final state.
- **Rendering/regression checks:**
  - Snapshot-style checks for key layer combinations (fog on/off, day/night, open/closed doors).
  - Performance smoke checks on representative map sizes (target stable interaction at 60 FPS class hardware).
- **Manual acceptance checklist per release:**
  - Two-window DM/player flow including freeze/unfreeze.
  - Ping visibility and timing behavior.
  - Custom map drag/drop + resize + save/reload fidelity.
  - Ctrl+S persistence across all active tool states.
